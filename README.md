# Welcome to the Can-Avert github project page!

`Can-Avert` is a mobile application that saves lives by notifying flood risks and providing Safe routes, tips and tricks and survival Guides

## Background :

Flood is the most dangerous natural disaster in the planet. According to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters , in 2016, floods killed the most people (4,731) , Where the NÂ°1 Cause of Death in a flood will be drowning.

Thereforwe can prevents such disasters where we can stop human losses if just we predicted the flood and notified all the citizens and the major actors such as Police? Firefighters and the civic society.

## Solution :

Our solution will be a mobile application that will predict floods, and therefor notifying the citizens about the flood, its intensity and its dangers and illustrating and simulating its movements.
Providing useful offline survival guides, hacks and tricks and it can be a tracking tool to be fully prepared for such a disaster.
Suggesting the safest routes to evacuate the place and how to protect ourselves from floods in future events.
The Application is easy to use, can be used online and offline and it is fast and reliable.

A Machine Learning Algorithm is responsible for the Flood prediction where it will process RAW LANDSAT, SRTM and NOAA images to produce DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) and identify the amount of Clay in the soil the approximate areas as it plays a major role to know whether a place is at risk more than other zones.
